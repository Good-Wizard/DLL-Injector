## Usage

1. Run as Administrator: Ensure the application is run with administrator privileges.
2. Select a DLL: Click the "Select DLL" button to choose the DLL file you want to inject.
3. Choose a Process: Select a process from the list of running processes.
4. Inject DLL: Click the "Inject DLL" button to inject the selected DLL into the chosen process.

## How It Works
1. The DLL Injector uses the Windows API to:
2. Open a target process with PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS permissions.
3. Allocate memory in the target process using VirtualAllocEx.
4. Write the DLL path into the allocated memory using WriteProcessMemory.
5. Create a remote thread in the target process to load the DLL using CreateRemoteThread.
6. Clean up resources after injection.
